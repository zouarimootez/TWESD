Project Repository
This repository contains two directories: agent_framework and ollama. The agent_framework directory includes tools and configurations for an agent-based framework, while the ollama directory provides scripts to set up and run the Ollama Large Language Model (LLM) using Docker. This README provides instructions to clone the repository and set it up using Docker Compose.

Prerequisites
Git installed on your system.
Docker and Docker Compose installed for running the Ollama LLM and other services.
Access to a terminal or command-line interface.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of this repository and <repository-name> with the name of the cloned directory.

2. Set Up Environment Files
Both agent_framework and ollama directories contain a .env.example file that needs to be copied to .env.

Copy .env.example to .env in agent_framework:
bash
cp agent_framework/.env.example agent_framework/.env
Copy .env.example to .env in ollama:
bash
cp ollama/.env.example ollama/.env
Configure the .env files:
Open agent_framework/.env and ollama/.env in a text editor.
Update the environment variables (e.g., API keys, configuration settings) as needed, following the instructions or comments in the .env.example files.
3. Run Docker Compose
The docker-compose.yml file in the root directory is configured to manage services for both agent_framework and ollama.

Ensure you are in the repository root:
bash
cd <repository-name>
Start the services: Run the following command to build and start the containers:
bash
docker-compose up -d
This will:
Build and run the Ollama LLM container using the Dockerfile in the ollama directory.
Set up any services defined for agent_framework (if applicable) in the docker-compose.yml.
Stop the services (when needed): To stop and remove the running containers:
bash
docker-compose down
Notes
The .gitignore file ensures sensitive files like .env are not tracked by Git.
Ensure Docker is running before executing docker-compose up.
The start.sh script in the ollama directory is not needed when using Docker Compose, as the docker-compose.yml handles the setup.
If Python dependencies are required for agent_framework, they are assumed to be handled within the Docker container. If manual installation is needed, refer to agent_framework/requirements.txt.
Troubleshooting
Docker issues: Verify Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running. Check logs with docker-compose logs if services fail to start.
Environment file issues: Ensure .env files are correctly configured and do not contain syntax errors.
Ollama LLM issues: Confirm internet connectivity for downloading the LLM model and verify the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml configurations.
